    "description": "<p>Processing environment resource.</p><h3>Usage context</h3><p>In the \"Detecting deforestation using data cubes and deep learning\" application, the <a href=\"https://rstudio.github.io/renv/\">renv</a> package manages the dependencies used in the processing scripts. However, sometimes these dependencies can be unavailable (e.g., server changes, package changes). To avoid this problem, the complete environment required to run the processing scripts in the package was packaged in a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/\">Docker Image</a>.</p><p>You can download this Docker image, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/\">import</a> it, and use the same environment to reproduce the application results or create new ones.</p><h3>FIles</h3><p>This processing environment resource has two files:</p><ul><li><strong>sits-environment.tar</strong>: Environment in a tar file that can be imported in a Docker environment;</li><li><strong>docker-description.txt</strong>: Description of the Docker environment used to create the Docker Image (You can check this file if you are struggling with compatibility issues. You may need to run the same version used to produce the tar file. Leave a comment if required).</li></ul><h3>Accessing the Docker image</h3><p>You can use the section below to download the Docker Image and import it into your environment.</p>",
