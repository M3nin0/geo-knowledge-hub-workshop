    "description": "<p>Application bootstrap resource</p><h3>Usage context</h3><p>All the resources of the application \"Detecting deforestation using data cubes and deep learning\" are centralized in the GEO Knowledge Hub. However, in case you need to run the scripts, some manual steps must be performed:</p><ol><li>Download the Docker Image;</li><li>Import the Docker Image;</li><li>Download the processing scripts;</li><li>Configuration of the processing scripts as a volume of the Docker environment;</li><li>Run the Docker image to generate a Docker Container;</li><li>Run the processing scripts in the Docker Container.</li></ol><p>To avoid these steps being done manually, the Application bootstrap file was created in this application. This bootstrap is a <a href=\"https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make.html\">Makefile</a> that automates all the steps presented above. With this Makefile, the operations become more straightforward and practical. Also, the steps needed for the execution are explicitly documented.</p><h3>Files</h3><p>This resource has the Makefile file. This file can be executed with the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html\">make tool</a>. It has the following operations available:</p><ul><li><strong>download</strong>: Downloads the files needed for execution;</li><li><strong>run</strong>: Executes the complete processing workflow using the Docker image and the data available in the Knowledge Package of the application \"Detecting deforestation using data cubes and deep learning\";</li><li><strong>help</strong>: Help command, which displays the description of the commands.</li></ul><p>For the download and run commands, you must set the following variables as arguments at runtime:</p><ul><li><strong>GKHUB_API_ADDRESS</strong>: Address of the GEO Knowledge Hub API (e.g., gkhub.earthobservations.org);</li><li><strong>RECORD_SCRIPTS_ID</strong>: Identifier of the script resource (e.g., vxqpw-dmn36). You can check this ID by going to the processing scripts resource page and looking up the URL of the page;</li><li><strong>RECORD_ENVIRONMENT_ID</strong>: Identifier of the processing environment resource (e.g., vxqpw-dmn36). You can check this ID by accessing the processing environment resource page and referring to the page URL.</li></ul><h3>Accessing the Application boostrap file</h3><p>You can download the bootstrap Makefile in the section below.</p>",
