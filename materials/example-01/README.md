## Detecting deforestation using data cubes and deep learning

The Knowledge Package "Detecting deforestation using data cubes and deep learning" presents how the sits package can be used to generate deforestation maps, using time series extracted from data cubes and Deep Learning algorithms.

This directory is a [Knowledge Package Repository](https://github.com/geo-knowledge-hub/geo-package-loader#knowledge-package-repository) containing all the files and metadata needed to publish the package on GEO Knowledge Hub. In total, 7 Knowledge Resources are available:

1. `Article`: Article describing the application methodology
2. `Deforestation Map`: Deforestation map generated with the application
3. `Trained ML Model`: Trained ML Model used to generate the LULC Map
4. `Data Cube`: Data Cube used to extract the input time-series data to generate the LULC Map
5. `Processing scripts`: Processing scripts used to handle data, train model and generate the application results
6. `Samples`: Deforestation samples used to train the ML Model
7. `Docs`: Softwate documentation to support the use and customization of the processing scripts
